        "description": "Latte mugs are specially designed cups used for serving lattes and other espresso-based drinks. They are typically larger than standard coffee mugs, holding around 12 to 16 ounces of liquid, to accommodate both the espresso and the steamed milk. Latte mugs often have a wide mouth and a curved shape, which helps showcase latte art and enhances the drinking experience. Theyâ€™re usually made from ceramic, porcelain, or glass, offering good insulation and a comfortable feel in the hand. Latte mugs combine function and style, making them a popular choice for both home baristas and coffee shops.",
